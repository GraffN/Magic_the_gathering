                            First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Magic was the first trading card game
                            produced and it continues to thrive, with approximately twenty million players as of 2015.
                            Magic can be played by two or more players in various formats, which fall into one of two
                            categories: constructed or limited. Limited formats involve players building a deck
                            spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards. The other
                            major category of formats is constructed. In constructed, players created decks from cards
                            they own, usually 60 cards with no more than 4 of any given card. Magic is played in person
                            with printed cards, or using a deck of virtual cards through the Internet-based Magic: The
                            Gathering Online, or on a smartphone or tablet, or through other programs.

                                Each game represents a battle between wizards known as "planeswalkers", who employ
                                spells, artifacts, and creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their
                                opponents. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of
                                traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons Dragons, the gameplay of Magic
                                bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially
                                more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.

                                    New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized
                                    tournament system played at an international level and a worldwide community of
                                    professional Magic players has developed, as well as a substantial secondary market
                                    for Magic cards. Certain Magic cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility
                                    in game play, with prices ranging from a few cents to thousands of dollars.

                                    Each player starts the game with 20 life. Knock your opponent down to 0 life, and
                                    you win. The most common way to do this is to summon creatures and attack with them.

                                        Creature cards are the most important part of many Magic decks. They’re really
                                        easy to spot—just look at the lower right of a card. If you see a pair of
                                        numbers separated by a slash, you’ve got a creature card. Once it’s on the
                                        battlefield, a creature continues to attack and defend for you until your
                                        opponent can find a way to take it out.

                                            Most games become a race to see who can deal the most damage first.
                                            Summoning the best creatures will help you win that race every time. Check
                                            out the section on casting creature spells.
